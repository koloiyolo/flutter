# About

This repository contains all my projects created using [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/learn-flutter) framework.

It contains: 
* [warframe_tracker]() -- simple mobile tracker of [Warframe](https://www.warframe.com/game/about) in-game events.
* [weather_app]() -- simple and eye pleasing weather app utilizing user's current location and [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/api) API.
* [library_management]() -- My final project for *Programowanie w Å›rodowiskach zintegrowanych* course at university.
* [fitness_app]() -- **discarded** -- Early concept for diploma project I planned to develop with my friend @Peterr181. Finally I've chosen totally diffrent topic due to my lack of knowledge in this branch.
